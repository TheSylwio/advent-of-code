# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a programming event, where everyday you try to solve an algoritmic riddle.

The technology I use here is `Node.js`, but you can use any language to participate!\
Directory `DayX` includes: 
* script `index.js` 
* description `README.md`
* input data `input.txt`
